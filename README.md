# makethumbsf6

## Make thumbnails, responsive images and HTML/Zurb Foundation 6 markup all in one go!

A _bash_ script, put it in `~/bin`, `chmod +x makethumbsf6` and for a first (standalone) try run it from _inside_ the `sample-gallery` folder.

It should create a set of subfolders:
  `t` (thumbnails)
  `ts` (squared & cropped thumbnails)
  `s` (responsive images for small screens)
  `m` (responsive images for medium screens)
  `l` (resonsive images for large screens)
  `xl` (responsive images for extra-large screens)
  
It’ll also generate a HTML sample file with a lightbox and almost all documentation included.

You might want to peek at the code—makethumbsf6 is very well documented and has a lot of customization settings.

More documentation will follow.
